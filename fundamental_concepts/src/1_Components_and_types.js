Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and 
think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction 
to the idea of components. You can find a detailed component API reference here.

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary 
inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear 
on the screen.

There are two types of components class based and function based

    Functional                          |                    Class
                                        |
    1. Simple functions                 |          1. More feature rich
    2. Solution without using state     |          2. Uses state
    3. Abscenece of this keyword        |          3. This keyword is present  
    4. Mainly for UI purpose            |          4. For more than just UI
    
**** NOTE: functions can now maintain state using hooks


Functioning: Both takes in props and return a JSX;
